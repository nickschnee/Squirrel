#### 🐿️ 🌳 Come along on a journey to explore the mysterious world of Central Park's squirrel population!

As we set out on our quest to uncover the optimal locations and weather conditions for observing Central Park's squirrel population, we found ourselves asking two key questions: where are the squirrels most likely to be spotted, and how does the weather affect their behavior?

To answer the first question, we explored the hectare-by-hectare distribution of squirrel sightings throughout the park. Our data analysis revealed that certain areas of the park are more conducive to squirrel sightings than others. In fact, we discovered that one particular hectare had the highest frequency of squirrel sightings, making it the best location to visit for any aspiring squirrel watcher.

Next, we turned our attention to the weather. Could the temperature, precipitation, or time of day affect squirrel behavior and, therefore, their visibility to park-goers? Through our statistical analysis, we were able to identify specific weather conditions that are correlated with higher rates of squirrel sightings. Without giving away too much, we can say that certain temperatures and shifts in weather patterns seem to be particularly conducive to spotting squirrels.

As our investigation drew to a close, we couldn't help but feel a sense of awe at the intricate dance between the squirrels and their environment. We hope that our findings will not only help visitors to Central Park have a more enjoyable and fruitful squirrel-watching experience, but also contribute to our collective understanding of these fascinating creatures and their role in the natural world.


# 📋 Datasets

In order to answer our research question, we've been working with data from "The Squirrel Census". The squirrel census was a multimedia science project focusing on the Eastern gray (Sciurus carolinensis) squirrel in Central Park in New York City. It was conducted in October 2018, with the help of 323 volunteer Squirrel Sighters.

We've been working with the following two datasets from The Squirrel Census:

#### 🐿️ Squirrel Data
Dataset: 2018_Central_Park_Squirrel_Census_-_Squirrel_Data.csv

This table contains squirrel data for each of the 3,023 sightings, including location coordinates, age, primary and secondary fur color, elevation, activities, communications, and interactions between squirrels and with humans.

#### 📍 Hectare Data
Dataset: 2018_Central_Park_Squirrel_Census_-_Hectare_Data.csv

This table contains environmental data related to each of the 350 “countable” hectares of Central Park. Examples include weather, litter, animals sighted, and human density. 

# 🧹 Cleaning and Preparing the Data

```{r import_datasets, echo = FALSE}

hectare <- read.csv("2018_Central_Park_Squirrel_Census_-_Hectare_Data.csv")
squirrels <- read.csv("2018_Central_Park_Squirrel_Census_-_Squirrel_Data.csv")

```

Squirrel Sighters recorded temperature and weather conditions during their observations in a loosely structured comma-separated list. To process this weather data, we identified the most frequently occurring weather conditions and extracted the temperature values. To accomplish this, we firstly converted the list to lowercase and analyzed the recorded data. 

Here is an example of how weather data was recorded by Squirrel Sighters:

``` {r glimpse}

weather <- tolower(hectare$Sighter.Observed.Weather.Data)
head(weather)

```

### 🌡️ Extracting Temperature

Since temperature values were typically the only numerical data in the recorded list, we extracted them from the string using a regular expression (regex). Furthermore, we converted the temperature values from Fahrenheit to Celsius to ensure consistency across our analyses. The extracted and converted temperature data, we put into a new column.

``` {r fahr_to_cels}

library(stringr)

# find temperature with regex
temp_fahrenheit <- as.numeric(str_extract(weather, "\\d+"))


# define function to convert from F to C
fahrenheit_to_celsius <- function(x) {
  if(!is.na(x)){
    (x - 32) * 5/9
  } else {
    NA
  }
}

# convert to celsius and then round to one decimal
temp_celsius <- round(sapply(temp_fahrenheit, fahrenheit_to_celsius), 1)

# add column to file
hectare$temperature_celsius <- temp_celsius

```

### 🌧️ Extracting Weather Conditions

We wanted to find out the weather conditions that were most commonly reported in our dataset. To do this, we separated the weather descriptions in the recorded list by splitting them at the commas.

``` {r weather_conditions}

weather_split <- str_split(weather, ",")


```

We then counted the number of occurrences for each weather condition in our dataset.

```` {r weather_unique}

unique_weather <- str_trim(unique(unlist(weather_split)))
weather_no_numbers <- str_trim(unlist(weather_split), side = "both")[!str_detect(str_trim(unlist(weather_split), side = "both"), "\\d")]
top_10 <- sort(table(weather_no_numbers), decreasing = TRUE)[1:10]
top_10


````

Based on the weather conditions that appeared most frequently in our dataset, we created distinct groups of weather conditions. We carefully scanned the entire dataset for synonyms and categorized all weather conditions as follows:

| Weather Category | Adjectives                                                     |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Sun              | sunny, clear, bright, blue, pleasant, perfect, not a cloud, nice, fair, crisp |
| Clouds           | overcast, cloudy, dreary, gray, not a cloud                  |
| Drizzle          | light rain, drizzle, drizzling, drizzly, sprinkling, lite rain, couple drops of rain, a few raindrops |
| Rain             | rain, rainy, wet, showers, heavy rain, pouring, drenching, torrential, downpour, cloudburst |
| Wind             | windy, breezy, brisk, gusty                         |
| Fog              | foggy, misty                                                   |
| Humid            | humid, muggy, damp, moist                                     |

These categories and adjectives were not suitable for our analysis:

| Weather Category | Adjectives                                                     |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Temperature      | cool, chilly, cold, warm, dewy, dewpoint, mild                |
| Other            | artsy lighting, got dark very suddenly, shady, sun starting to go down |
| No Wind          | calm, no wind                                                  |


Subsequently, we developed a function to check each row of the hectare-dataset for the presence of the specific weather-adjectives from the table above. If a condition was found in a given row, we assigned a value of "true" to the corresponding (new) column. If not, we assigned a value of "false" to the same column. We repeated this process for all weather conditions of interest, creating a new column with a boolean value for each condition. 

For illustrative purposes, below one example of this process applied to the "sunny" weather condition:

```` {r weather_detect}

detect_weather <- function(x, words_positive, words_negative = character(0)) {
  detect <- any(str_detect(x, paste(words_positive, collapse = "|")))
  if (detect == TRUE && length(words_negative) > 0) {
    not_detect <- any(str_detect(x, paste(words_negative, collapse = "|")))
    if (not_detect == TRUE) {
      detect <- FALSE
    }
  }
  detect
}

words_sun <- c("sun", "clear", "bright", "blue", "pleasant", "perfect", "not a cloud", "nice", "fair", "crisp")

sunny <- sapply(weather_split, function(x) detect_weather(x, words_sun))
sunny[1:10]

````


### ➕ Merging Datasets

As a last step we wanted to assign each squirrel sighting the corresponding hectare conditions. To that end we merged the two datasets based on hectare, shift and date:

```` {r merge files}

write.csv(hectare, "hectare_weather.csv")
joint <- merge(squirrels, hectare, by=c("Hectare", "Shift", "Date"))
write.csv(joint, "joint_squirrels.csv")

````


# 📊 Data Analysis

```` {r squirrel_import}

weather <- read.csv("hectare_weather.csv")
squirrels <- read.csv("joint_squirrels.csv")
hectare <- read.csv("2018_Central_Park_Squirrel_Census_-_Hectare_Grid.csv")

````


### Number of Squirrel Sighting per Hectare

We used a first plot to display the number of squirrels sighted per hectare.

```` {r squirrel_scatter, warning=FALSE}

plot(weather$Hectare, weather$Number.of.Squirrels, 
     xlab="Hectare ID", 
     ylab="Number of Squirrel Sightings",
     main="Squirrel Sightings per Hectare in Central Park")

````


### Squirrel Density by Hectare

We quickly realised that the scatterplot created at first was of little relevance. As a consequence, we decided for a different approach, namely a heatmap-grid. The grid combined with a heatmap has the advantage that it provides a visualization along the geographic ramifications that Central Park's hectare structure defines.

```` {r squirrel_heatmap, warning = FALSE}

library(ggplot2)

# Heatmap with squirrels per hectare in central park
ggplot(data = weather, cache = TRUE, aes(x = as.numeric(substr(Hectare, 1, 2)), 
                           y = as.factor(substr(Hectare, 3, 3)), 
                           fill = Number.of.Squirrels)) +
  geom_tile() +
  geom_text(aes(label = Hectare), color = "darkgrey", size = 3, vjust = 0.5) +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "white", high = "brown") +

  scale_y_discrete(limits = c("A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", "G", "H", "I"), expand = c(0, 0)) +
  labs(x = "Grid Column (1-42)", y = "Grid Row (A-I)", fill = "Number of Squirrels") +
  theme_classic() +
  ggtitle("Squirrel density per hectare") +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")

````

# 🗺️ Squirrel Map from Geodata (chapter of choice)
After analyzing the heatmap, we can draw the conclusion that the highest concentration of squirrels was reported in Hectare 14E. To provide more value to our visitors, we decided to plot all the squirrel sightings on a geographical map. In this map, we color-coded the sightings within Hectare 14E in red and all other sightings in blue. This makes it easier for visitors to identify the best locations for squirrel-watching in Central Park.


```` {r map_install, echo=TRUE, include=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

library(osmdata)
library(sf)
library(ggmap)

squirrels <- read.csv("joint_squirrels.csv")

First we set the bounding box (= frame) of our map, then we draw the map using ggmap()
```` {r map_boundingbox}

longitude_min <- min(squirrels$X) - 0.005
latitude_min <- min(squirrels$Y) - 0.001
longitude_max <- max(squirrels$X) + 0.005
latitude_max <- max(squirrels$Y) + 0.001

# Background map
mad_map <- get_map(location = c(left = longitude_min, bottom = latitude_min, right = longitude_max, top = latitude_max),
                   source = "stamen",
                   maptype = "toner-background",
                   zoom = 15,
                   cache = TRUE)

d.stations <- data.frame(Latitude = squirrels$Y, 
                         Longitude = squirrels$X)

ggmap(mad_map) +
  geom_point(data = squirrels,
             aes(x = X, y = Y, color = ifelse(Hectare == "14B", "red", "gray"), alpha = 0.5),

While it is nice to see a heatmap of each weather condition, we also wanted to display several within the same grid.

# 📈 Models

Applying a Poisson regression, which is suitable when working with sum data, we wanted to estimate the influence and predictive power of weather on the probability of spotting a squirrel.

## Sightings by Weather

```` {r model_glm_weather}

model <- glm(Number.of.Squirrels ~ sunny + drizzly + cloudy + foggy + rainy + humid,
             data = weather,
             family = poisson())

summary(model)

````

According to the results, the presence of rainy weather significantly decreases the expected number of squirrels, while the presence of drizzly and humid weather significantly increases the expected number of squirrels. The presence of sunny weather has a small, but not significant, negative effect on the expected number of squirrels. The presence of cloudy and foggy weather does not have a significant effect on the expected number of squirrels.

The residual deviance of 2066.5 on 693 degrees of freedom indicates that the model fits the data well, as the residual deviance is smaller than the null deviance. The AIC of 4069.7 also suggests that the model is a good fit to the data.

Overall, these results suggest that the number of squirrels observed in Central Park may be influenced by the weather conditions, particularly the presence of rainy, drizzly, and humid weather.


## Shift and Temperature

```` {r model_glm_time_temp}

reg <- glm(Number.of.Squirrels ~ temperature_celsius * Shift, data = weather, family = poisson())
summary(reg)

````

Overall, this model suggests that the number of squirrels is influenced by both temperature and shift, with the effect of temperature depending on the time of the shift. Specifically, there is a positive relationship between the number of squirrels and both temperature and shift, but the effect of temperature is stronger in the morning than in the afternoon.

# 🐿️❤️ What does this mean for you, squirrel lover?

According to our statistical models, the best time to see the most squirrels is in the afternoon and during drizzly or humid weather. On the other hand, rainy weather conditions are associated with fewer squirrels seen. While temperature also plays a role, its effect is stronger in the morning than in the afternoon. So, if you want to increase your chances of seeing squirrels in Central Park, plan your visit for the afternoon and keep an eye out for drizzly or humid weather.
